## I have performed Important Data Preparation Steps like
1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Statistical Analysis
## Packages that I have used
1. Numpy and Pandas: To modify the data and gain insights
2. Matplotlib and Seaborn: To visualize data
3. Scipy.stats: To perform Z-Test,T-Test, ANOVA,Correlation and Chi-square
